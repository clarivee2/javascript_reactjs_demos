# Javascript / ReactJS Tutorials / API examples

This is just an attempt at putting work and code from a variety of tutorials, namely the ReactJS Facebook examples into one or more working apps.  

Also overloading this to encapsulate API examples.

*NOTE* - The code is not intended to be bleeding-edge nor is it intended to be fully correct.

## Javascript / ReactJS Tutorials
- fbtutorial - facebook tutorial / walk-through examples with a few liberties taken
- helloworld - create app working

## API Examples/Tutorials
- TodoApi - from walkthrough at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api - only step 1 for now. 

That's it for now - I will definitely tidy this up over time.
